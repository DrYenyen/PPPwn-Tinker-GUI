# PPPwn-Tinker-GUI
PPPwn-Tkinter-GUI was crafted with the goal of extending the functionality of the current PPPwn solutions. By altering the way in which the exploit is deployed and run, one can increase reliability to nearly 100%. This is often console-dependent, but it's better to experiment than not.

At present, PPPwn-Tkinter-GUI was made with Windows in mind. Hopefully this will be built upon soon. As it stands, there aren't any options to "save" a configuration, but this will also hopefully be added soon.

This tool is open-source and provided as-is. Under the hood it utilizes new functionality added to PPPwn_cpp by nn9dev with the help of Borris_ta (and is also open source!) 

Please be sure to read the instructions carefully, and happy Tkintering tinkering!
far more neutral tone I think
